# SDR-optimization
In the context of the DeepSeek big model's popularity, SDR work requires robot tools to optimize the workflow. This project features three robots: 

1. Automatic WeChat Friend - Adding Robot: It can automatically send friend requests on WeChat, streamlining the process of expanding the contact list.
2. Big - Model Writing Table Structured Data Retrieval Robot: This robot is designed to automatically extract structured data from the big - model writing table, facilitating data processing and analysis.
3. WeChat Real - time Monitoring and Intelligent Reply Assistant: It can monitor WeChat conversations in real - time and provide intelligent replies, improving communication efficiency.

The project will share the overall code structure while keeping personal information confidential. These robots are expected to enhance SDR work efficiency, allowing staff to focus more on high - value tasks.
